# Todo

This page contains a list of TODOs for building the knowledgebase. To add Todos, we are 2 options:
 - Add a todo item below
 - Or add an in-context item with the [[todo]] link on another page (These will show as backlinks here)

- [ ] Prepare getting started section of readme 

## Using Todos
- [ ] You can mark it completed by pressing `Option`+`C` (or `Alt`+`C`) when your cursor is on this line
  - [ ] You can also select multiple lines and mark them all at once!
- [ ] When you press enter at the end of a line, it adds a new todo item on the next line
- [ ] This, and more is provided by the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) plugin by [Yu Zhang](https://github.com/yzhang-gh)
