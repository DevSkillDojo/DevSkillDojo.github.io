## Dependent Skills
Before learning this skill, you should have at least some level of proficiency in a set of other skills. These are called the 
dependent skills and they are broken into weak and strong dependencies.

### Weak Dependencies
There is no clear definition of the skill level you require in these weak dependencies, but you should have some level of
proficiency in these dependency skills before learning the current skill. Of course, you could also learn these skills in 
parallel

- [[oauth2]]
- [[jwt]]
- [[ldap]]
- [[cas]]
- [[jaas]]
- [[http]]

### Strong Dependencies
For each proficiency level of the current skill, you must have achieved a clearly defined level of proficiency in a dependency skill.

- Level 4: TODO
- Level 5: TODO

### Sub Skills
Some skills represent a large body of knowledge and is broken down into sub-skills that can be mastered individually

## Learning Concepts
A list of concepts to be mastered. Often the number of concepts that have been mastered is a good indicator of proficiency level
